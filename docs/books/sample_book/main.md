# Goal of this Article

This article provides a detailed overview of Filter-Based Forwarding (**FBF**), also known as Policy-Based Routing (**PBR**), on MX Series routers (AFT), using common deployment scenarios to illustrate configuration methods.  

The Filter-Based Forwarding (FBF) concept is relatively simple. On ingress, filtering (via the Firewall Filter toolkit) is applied *before* the the source or destination route lookup. The diagram below illustrates this process. In a standard routing scenario without any constraints, the destination IP from the IP datagram is used for a rou te lookup (using Longest Prefix Match[^1]), which returns a next-hop and an associated egress interface. (Encapsulation may occur prior to egress.)

With FBF, we alter the ingress lookup behavior in one of the following ways:

- Forcing traffic to exit through a specific egress port;
- Using a "proxy" or alias IP address as the lookup key (as shown in our example below);
- Leveraging a specific, constrained forwarding instance to influence the lookup outcome.

To summarize, on Juniper platforms, FBF can generally be implemented using two main approaches. The first is more straightforward and involves minimal configuration, but offers limited flexibility. It uses a single firewall filter to directly redirect traffic. The second approach requires slightly more configuration but offers more granular traffic handling.

All examples are based on Junos OS release **24.2**. Weâ€™ll begin with the simpler method.
