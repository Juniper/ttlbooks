### Ready to Start Writing?

Before diving in, make sure you've completed the following steps:

- Create and switch to your dedicated branch  
- From your local directory, run:  
  ```bash
  git pull
  git checkout <your-branch>
  ```

- Edit your **`header.yml`** file (look for the `EDIT` placeholder)

> Once you're ready, reach out to a GitLab admin to have your book added to the `mkdocs.yml` file.

Happy writing!
